Description: episensr provides basic sensitivity analysis of the observed
	     relative risks adjusting for unmeasured confounding and
	     misclassification of the exposure/outcome, or both. It follows the
	     bias analysis methods and examples from the book by Lash T.L, Fox
	     M.P, and Fink A.K. Applying Quantitative Bias Analysis to
	     Epidemiologic Data, Springer, 2009.
