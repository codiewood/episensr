Description: Basic sensitivity analysis of the observed relative risks adjusting
    for unmeasured confounding and misclassification of the
    exposure/outcome, or both. It follows the bias analysis methods and
    examples from the book by Lash T.L, Fox M.P, and Fink A.K.
    "Applying Quantitative Bias Analysis to Epidemiologic Data",
    ('Springer', 2009).
